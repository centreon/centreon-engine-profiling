Installation
************

To install Centreon Profiling you need to build your own version.
See INSTALL file.

*************
Configuration
*************

No file configuration is need to use Centreon Profiling. Juste add a
new line into the monitoring engine configuration to add the
broker module. Centreon Profiling module takes one argument, the
limit of stored informations by object.

For Nagios engine, add something like that ::

  $ broker_module=/usr/local/nagios/bin/profilingmod.so

For Centreon Engine use something like that ::

  $ broker_module=/usr/lib/centreon-engine/profilingmod.so

*****
Usage
*****

To control Centreon-Profiling we need to use the engine external
command.

Start profiling
===============

To start profiling we need to enable it with "_PROFILING_ENABLE". This
external command didn't have argument and reset internal profiling
cache.

Example ::

  $ NOW=$(date +%s)
  $ EXTCMD=/var/lib/centreon-engine/rw/centengine.cmd
  $ /usr/bin/printf "[%lu] _PROFILING_ENABLE\n" ${NOW} > ${EXTCMD}

Stop profiling
==============

To stop profiling we need to disable it with "_PROFILING_DISABLE". This
external command didn't have argument and reset internal profiling
cache.

Example ::

  $ NOW=$(date +%s)
  $ EXTCMD=/var/lib/centreon-engine/rw/centengine.cmd
  $ /usr/bin/printf "[%lu] _PROFILING_DISABLE\n" ${NOW} > ${EXTCMD}

Dump global informations
========================

To dump global informations we need to use "_PROFILING_SAVE_GLOBAL_STATISTICS"
external command.

========= =============================================================================
Argument  Description
========= =============================================================================
Log Path  File path to dump informations.
Sort      Sort methode (id, execution_time or latency).
Filter    Filter methode: can be 'all' or use some filters (seperated by coma): 
          [host, service], [active, passive], [notification, command, event_handler].
Limit     Show limit informations (0 is unlimited).
========= =============================================================================

#. Examples

Show all object sorted by execution_time ::

  $ NOW=$(date +%s)
  $ LOG_PATH=/var/lib/centreon-engine/rw/global_info.log
  $ EXTCMD=/var/lib/centreon-engine/rw/centengine.cmd
  $ SORT=execution_time
  $ FILTER=all
  $ /usr/bin/printf "[%lu] _PROFILING_SAVE_GLOBAL_STATISTICS;${LOG_PATH};${SORT};${FILTER};0\n" ${NOW} > ${EXTCMD}

Show only active hosts sorted by latency ::

  $ NOW=$(date +%s)
  $ LOG_PATH=/var/lib/centreon-engine/rw/global_info.log
  $ EXTCMD=/var/lib/centreon-engine/rw/centengine.cmd
  $ SORT=latency
  $ FILTER=host,active,command,event_handler
  $ /usr/bin/printf "[%lu] _PROFILING_SAVE_GLOBAL_STATISTICS;${LOG_PATH};${SORT};${FILTER};0\n" ${NOW} > ${EXTCMD}
